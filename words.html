	<center><h2> Read my work </h2></center>

<p>I have reported extensively on a variety of topics throughout New England, including politics, domestic violence, opioid addiction, crime, policing, housing and immigration. No matter the topic, I bring a document and data-driven approach, pairing a public-records mindset with shoe-leather reporting and an analytical eye. </p>
<br>
<p>I won first place for Environmental Reporting in 2016 in the New England Newspaper & Press Association's Better Newspaper Awards for my story about emerging contaminants in Vermont drinking water. In 2018, I co-published an investigative series looking at the failures that left a woman dead at the hands of her partner 48 hours after calling for help. We won a Vermont Press Award for Best Local Story.</p>
